# 🧠 Portfolio Analysis Function Explanation

This document explains the **concepts and logic** behind a portfolio
analysis function that evaluates how a set of stocks performs together
over time. It focuses on understanding returns, risk, and
diversification --- all using real-world financial principles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this analysis is to understand how different stocks
contribute to the performance of an investment portfolio. By combining
them strategically, investors can balance **risk and return** more
effectively. The function helps measure this performance through
standard portfolio metrics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Overview

The function accepts: - A list of **stock tickers** (symbols like
`AAPL`, `TSLA`, `INFY.NS`) - The **allocation weights** (the percentage
of total investment in each stock)

It then uses market data to calculate: - Average annual returns\
- Risk and volatility\
- Risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio)\
- Downside risk (maximum drawdown)\
- Relationships between stocks (correlation matrix)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Normalizing Weights

Ensures that the total investment adds up to 100%. This guarantees that
each stock's impact on performance is proportional to its share in the
portfolio.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2. Fetching Market Data

Retrieves one year of daily stock prices from Yahoo Finance. This
provides a historical basis to evaluate how each stock has performed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3. Calculating Daily Returns

Measures the **percentage change in price** from one day to the next.
These daily returns form the foundation for all further performance
calculations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4. Portfolio Daily Return

Each stock's return is multiplied by its allocation weight, and all are
summed up to get the **total daily return** for the portfolio.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5. Annualized Return & Volatility

Two key metrics derived from daily returns: - **Annualized Return** --
the average daily return scaled up for a year (approximately 250 trading
days). - **Volatility** -- how much the portfolio's returns fluctuate.
It reflects uncertainty or risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 6. Sharpe Ratio

A measure of **risk-adjusted return**. It compares how much excess
return the portfolio generates for every unit of risk taken (over a
risk-free rate like government bonds).\
\> A higher Sharpe Ratio = better performance for the risk level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Maximum Drawdown

Represents the **largest loss** from a portfolio's peak value to its
lowest point before recovery. It shows how much the portfolio could
decline during a rough market phase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. Correlation Matrix

Analyzes how each pair of stocks move relative to one another: -
**Positive correlation** → move together\
- **Negative correlation** → move in opposite directions\
Low or negative correlations indicate **good diversification**, reducing
total risk.

## 📊 Key Metrics Summary

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Metric                    Description
  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  **Annualized Return**     Expected yearly portfolio return based on
                            historical data

  **Volatility**            Degree of variation in portfolio returns
                            (risk indicator)

  **Sharpe Ratio**          Measures how efficiently returns are earned
                            for the level of risk

  **Max Drawdown**          Largest percentage loss from a peak to a
                            trough

  **Correlation Matrix**    Shows how individual assets move relative to
                            one another

## 💬 Summary

This portfolio analysis provides a clear picture of both the **potential
growth** and **risk exposure** of a group of investments.\
It's a powerful way to evaluate: - How well the portfolio is balanced\
- Whether returns justify the risk\
- How diversification affects performance

In short, it helps investors make **smarter, data-backed decisions** ---
understanding not just how much they might earn, but how much risk
they're taking to earn it.
