# Portfolio Analysis Function Explanation

This document explains how the portfolio analysis function works conceptually, without showing the code. It covers the logic, financial principles, and reasoning behind each step.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

The portfolio analysis function is designed to evaluate how a set of stocks performs together over a given period. It helps in understanding key aspects like expected returns, risk, and how well the portfolio is diversified. This is done using real market data from Yahoo Finance.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

The function takes a list of stock tickers and their respective allocations (weights) in the portfolio. Using these inputs, it analyzes historical price data for each stock and computes several key performance indicators.

---

## ðŸ§® Key Steps in the Analysis

### 1. **Normalizing Portfolio Weights**

The first step ensures that the allocations add up to 100%. This way, the contribution of each stock to the portfolio reflects its true weight.

---

### 2. **Fetching Market Data**

The function retrieves one year of historical closing prices for all the stocks in the portfolio. This provides the raw data needed for return calculations.

---

### 3. **Calculating Daily Returns**

From the closing prices, the daily percentage change in price is computed. This represents the stockâ€™s day-to-day profit or loss.

---

### 4. **Computing Portfolio Daily Returns**

Each stockâ€™s daily return is multiplied by its respective portfolio weight. The sum of these weighted returns gives the portfolioâ€™s overall daily return.

---

### 5. **Annualized Return and Volatility**

The function then estimates two key statistics:

* **Annualized Return:** The average daily return scaled to a full trading year (about 250 trading days). It shows how much the portfolio would earn annually, assuming the same average daily growth.
* **Volatility:** The standard deviation of daily returns, also scaled to a yearly figure. It reflects how much the portfolioâ€™s returns fluctuate over time â€” a measure of risk.

---

### 6. **Sharpe Ratio**

The Sharpe ratio measures how efficiently the portfolio generates returns relative to the amount of risk taken. It compares the portfolioâ€™s return over the risk-free rate to its volatility. A higher Sharpe ratio means better risk-adjusted performance.

---

### 7. **Maximum Drawdown**

This metric shows the worst drop the portfolio experienced from a peak to a trough. Itâ€™s useful to understand potential downside risk and how resilient the portfolio is during market declines.

---

### 8. **Correlation Matrix**

The correlation matrix measures how each pair of stocks moves relative to each other. A high correlation means they move similarly, while a low or negative correlation indicates diversification benefits.

| Metric                 | Description                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Annualized Return**  | Expected yearly portfolio return based on past data     |
| **Volatility**         | The degree of variation in returns; represents risk     |
| **Sharpe Ratio**       | Efficiency of returns relative to risk                  |
| **Max Drawdown**       | The largest percentage drop from a peak before recovery |
| **Correlation Matrix** | Statistical relationship among portfolio assets         |

## ðŸ’¬ Summary

The portfolio analysis function provides a complete snapshot of portfolio health â€” showing both the potential for growth and the level of risk involved. It helps investors make informed decisions, compare portfolio options, and understand how diversification affects performance.
